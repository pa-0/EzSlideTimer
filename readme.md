A simple timer tool written in C++ using Dear Imgui that can be used for easy presentation time-tracking.  
Forked from [Winterreisender](https://github.com/Winterreisender/)'s [original EzSlideTimer (Chinese version available here)](https://github.com/Winterreisender/EzSlideTimer) and translated to English for personal use.
